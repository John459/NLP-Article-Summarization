The Boulder Valley School District is planning to sell $225 million in bonds in February or March to pay for the first round of construction projects in its $576.5 million construction package.
The bond issue was approved by voters in November.
Construction is expected to start in the summer and continue for the next six to eight years, with the district repairing and upgrading all of its 55 schools, including rebuilding three elementary schools.
"We're feeling good about where we are in the planning process," said Superintendent Bruce Messinger.
"We want to keep the design work moving."
The first phase also includes planning for a new K-8 campus in Erie, which may either be a K-8 or a separate elementary and middle school.
