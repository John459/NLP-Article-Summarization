The Boulder City Council met behind closed doors for the first time Monday evening, the historic debut of the elected body's new voter-bestowed ability to discuss municipalization-related strategy and legal advice in secret.
The city's Channel 8 television network broadcast the public portion of the meeting, then, to the strains of a smooth-jazz soundtrack, continued to show the empty council chambers behind a placard indicating the body was meeting in executive session.
The ballot issue gave the City Council limited ability to meet in closed sessions to get legal advice and discuss negotiation strategy related to the formation of a municipal utility.
"No conversations at all, not even casual conversations, until I turn on the recorder," Carr said.
He also warned the council members to stay on topic: "If you think we've strayed, and two of you believe that, then we stop," he said.
"I'm hopeful that in the future we will find a way to release some or all of these tapes to the public, when there is no longer a risk to the city for us to do so," Councilman Sam Weaver told his colleagues.
"Be thinking of it as it if could be a future public document."
