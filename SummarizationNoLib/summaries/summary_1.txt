Boulder's Human Relations Commission will hold a public hearing on a living wage for employees in the city Thursday evening at the West Senior Center.
Colorado's minimum wage is currently $8 and will increase to $8.23 on Jan. 1.
A 2011 study from the University of Washington's Center for Women's Welfare found a single adult would need to make an hourly wage of at least $11.60 to live self-sufficiently in Boulder County.
The five person council-appointed Human Relations Commission advises the City Council and wants to recommend that the council consider the issue of a living wage be added to its work plan, Atilano said.
