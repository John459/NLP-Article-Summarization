The new and improved Museum of Boulder, scheduled to open at Broadway and Pine Street in 2017, celebrated a $500,000 grant awarded Wednesday by the National Endowment for the Humanities, a major step in a multimillion-dollar fundraising effort that now enters its final stretch.
With the NEH grant, 2A and another $1 million secured prior to Election Day, the Museum of Boulder is almost 70 percent of the way toward its original fundraising goal of $8 million, which would allow the museum to move into the Boulder Masonic Lodge, 2205 Broadway, and vastly expand its programming and exhibitions.
"And what this NEH grant shows is this is a very viable project, and it's more than just the Boulder community that recognizes that."
"With the expansion into the new building and our rebranding as the Museum of Boulder, we are not only going to tell the really cool stories of Boulder's history, but we're also going to bring the museum up to what's going on in Boulder today," Geyer said.
She added that the new space will host exhibits and programs that showcase the city's innovation in science and technology, natural foods, athletics and more, in addition to the existing history-focused features.
The city's rich past and present both deserve more than local recognition, museum chairman Bob Yates said.
"We have done an adequate job of reflecting the history and character, but we can do much better," he said.
The Museum of Boulder now turns its attention to the final portion of fundraising, which it hopes to complete mainly through individual and corporate donations.
Yates said he hopes to secure the final $2.5 million by the end of 2015 and that renovations could start as soon as early 2016.
"We're going to be able to create this really great museum much more quickly.
