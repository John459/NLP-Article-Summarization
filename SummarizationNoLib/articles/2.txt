Boulder police investigating phone scammers pretending to be officers.
Boulder police are investigating a phone scam in which callers pretending to be officers ask their targets for money to dismiss arrests warrants or fines, according to a news release.

So far, Boulder police have received six complaints. Victims said caller ID shows that the calls are coming from the Boulder police non-emergency dispatch number, 303-441-3333, likely using a cloning software program.

Once on the phone, the caller -- described as having a "heavy, east-Indian accent" -- tells the target they will be arrested unless they put up money to "take care of" arrest warrants or pay "educational fines."

Boulder police dispatch has also received calls from the number, but the caller hung up when the call was answered both times.

Boulder police said they do not ask people for money in exchange for handling criminal matters.

Anyone with information can call Boulder police at 303-441-333.Those who wish to remain anonymous may contact the Northern Colorado Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS or crimeshurt.com.
