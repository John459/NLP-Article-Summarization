A hacker or hackers took over the Longmont Humane Society's website Monday evening, but an official there says personal information from people who made online contributions has not been compromised.

The website had been taken down as of noon Tuesday as an outside firm worked to restore it, according to LHS Executive Director Liz Smokowski.

She said the hack appears to be from a person or group calling itself the Arab Warriors Team, which has posted messages asking for Syrian and Palestinian prisoners to be released.

Smokowski said the LHS has reported the hack to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

She expected the website to be repaired in the next few hours.
